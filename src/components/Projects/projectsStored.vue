      StakeHolderDesc:"PIT stands for Practoraat Interactieve Technologie. PIT collaborates with teachers from different schools to improve lessons through technology. For my internship, I will work with one of these teachers to realize his idea for enhancing his lessons using my ICT knowledge. My stakeholder for this project is Igor, an ICT teacher at ROC in Tilburg. He has been facing the issue that students find it difficult to learn how to work with server racks because the physical space is too small. Therefore, he wants a digital simulation of server racks so that students can learn to work with them without needing to handle them physically. It is my task to come up with a good solution for this and to implement it.",
      theProblemDesc:"Due to limited space and server racks, not all students studying ICT at ROC can always work with physical server racks. This is unfortunate because it means students cannot learn everything for this course in their own time. The goal of the project was to give students the opportunity to learn how to work with these server racks without having to use them physically. They can easily use a simulation on their computer/phone that explains how these racks are assembled. Additionally, through gamification, they receive assignments with the digital server rack, helping them learn to work with it effectively. XR technology is also used to create an even more realistic simulation for these lessons.",
      description: "For PIT, I created an AR application that can be used on both phones and tablets. With this application, you can use augmented reality and the camera to place a simulated server cabinet in your room. You can disassemble the server cabinet and view all the different components along with their names.",
